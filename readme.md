## üìñ Description

This repository contains the frontend code for Kiarash Bashokian's interactive personal portfolio website. The web application serves as a dynamic and visually engaging showcase of his skills, projects, and knowledge.

Key features include:
* **Smooth Animations:** Fluid transitions and animations enhance the user experience, including text reveals and section transitions.
* **Dynamic Background Gradients:** Clicking the central logo smoothly transitions the background through a predefined set of beautiful color gradients.
* **Interactive Navigation:** Users can navigate between different sections (Introduction, Knowledge, Project Details) using intuitive UI elements like clickable titles and scroll icons.
* **Responsive Design Principles:** Built with considerations for various screen sizes (though specific breakpoints should be tested).
* **Optimized Build Process:** Uses Gulp for efficient SCSS compilation, CSS auto-prefixing, CSS minification, and JavaScript minification.

The target audience includes visitors wishing to learn more about Kiarash, potential employers, collaborators, and developers interested in the interactive design.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

This project leverages modern web technologies and build tools:

* **Core:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla ES6+)
* **Styling:** SCSS (Sass) for modular and maintainable stylesheets.
* **Build System:** Node.js & npm for package management.
* **Task Runner:** Gulp for automating development tasks:
    * `gulp-sass`: Compiling SCSS to CSS.
    * `gulp-postcss` with `autoprefixer`: Adding vendor prefixes to CSS for cross-browser compatibility.
    * `cssnano`: Minifying CSS for production.
    * `gulp-uglify`: Minifying JavaScript for production.
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## üìÅ Project Structure

The repository follows a standard structure for a frontend project with a build process:

<pre>
.
‚îÇ   .gitignore         # Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore
‚îÇ   gulpfile.js        # Gulp configuration file defining build tasks
‚îÇ   index.html         # Main HTML entry point for the application
‚îÇ   package-lock.json  # Records exact versions of dependencies
‚îÇ   package.json       # Project metadata and dependency list
‚îÇ   readme.md          # This README file
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄcss                # Compiled CSS output directory
‚îÇ       style.css      # Compiled and potentially minified CSS
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄjs                 # JavaScript source directory
‚îÇ       main.js        # Main JavaScript file containing application logic and interactions
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄscss               # SCSS source directory
style.scss     # Main SCSS file, imports other partials if any

*(Note: The `uglified-js` folder mentioned in `gulpfile.js` will be created upon running the `script` task to store minified JavaScript, but it's not present in the source structure).*
</pre>

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Instructions

To set up the project locally for development or modification, follow these steps:

**Prerequisites:**
* **Node.js & npm:** Ensure you have Node.js installed. npm comes bundled with it. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). Verify installation by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal.
* **Git:** Ensure you have Git installed to clone the repository. [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/SOBI-THE-GOD/portfolio-project.git](https://github.com/SOBI-THE-GOD/portfolio-project.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to Project Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd portfolio-project
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    This command reads the `package.json` file and installs the necessary development dependencies (like Gulp and its plugins).
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can run the project:

1.  **Run the Gulp Build & Watch Task:**
    This command executes the default Gulp task defined in `gulpfile.js`. It will:
    * Compile `scss/style.scss` into `css/style.css`.
    * Apply autoprefixing and minify the CSS.
    * Minify `js/main.js` into the `uglified-js` directory (though `index.html` links to the source `js/main.js` by default - adjust `index.html` or `gulpfile.js` if needed for production builds).
    * Start watching the `scss` and `js` directories for changes, automatically recompiling/minifying when files are saved.
    ```bash
    gulp
    ```
    *Keep this terminal window open while developing.*

2.  **View the Application:**
    Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can usually do this by double-clicking the file or using a live server extension in your code editor (like Live Server for VS Code).

**Key Interactions:**
* üñ±Ô∏è Click the central 'K' logo to change the background gradient.
* üñ±Ô∏è Hover over the main content area and navigation titles to see subtle gradient effects.
* üñ±Ô∏è Click on project titles in the navigation to view their details (if implemented).
* üñ±Ô∏è Use the scroll down/up arrows (Chevron icons) to navigate between the Introduction and Knowledge sections.

    * Update `scss/style.scss` (and potentially create new `.scss` partials) to match your desired visual style.
    * Adjust `js/main.js` if you need different animations or interactions. You might want to update the `colorGradsArr` with your preferred gradients.
    * **Crucially:** Update the author information in `package.json` and any visible attributions (like the footer) to reflect your own authorship.
4.  **Install & Run:** Follow the [Installation](#Ô∏è-installation-instructions) and [Usage](#Ô∏è-usage) steps above.

**Contributing to *This* Repository:**

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourImprovement` or `bugfix/IssueDescription`).
3.  Make your changes and test thoroughly.
4.  Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).

## üìù Additional Notes

* The project relies heavily on vanilla JavaScript for DOM manipulation and animations, showcasing proficiency without relying on heavy frameworks for this specific use case.
* The Gulp build process ensures optimized and cross-browser compatible assets.
* The dynamic gradient feature (`changeGradSmoothly` function in `main.js`) provides a unique and memorable user experience.
* The `validator()` function in `main.js` seems to perform a simple check on the footer content; ensure this doesn't cause issues if modifying the footer significantly.
